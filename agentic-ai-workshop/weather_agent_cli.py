You are an expert at working with the National Weather Service (NWS) API.

Your task: Generate the proper sequence of NWS API calls to get weather forecast data for "{location}".

Instructions:
1. First, determine the approximate latitude and longitude coordinates for this location
2. Use the NWS Points API: https://api.weather.gov/points/{{lat}},{{lon}}
3. The Points API will return a forecast URL in the response
4. You need to make TWO API calls in sequence:
   - First: Points API to get forecast office and grid coordinates
   - Second: The forecast URL returned from the Points API

For the coordinates, use your knowledge to estimate:
- Major cities: Use well-known coordinates
- ZIP codes: Estimate based on the area
- States: Use approximate center coordinates

Example for Seattle:
1. https://api.weather.gov/points/47.6062,-122.3321
2. (This will return a forecast URL like: https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/SEW/124,67/forecast)

Now generate the FIRST API call (Points API) for "{location}". 
Return ONLY the complete Points API URL, nothing else.
Format: https://api.weather.gov/points/LAT,LON
